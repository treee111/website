# Welcome to my corner of the World Wide Web

I'm a software developer by trade and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently they let anyone put websites online these days, so welcome to mine.

### My life right now

I'm a Senior Platform Engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and am currently working remotely around the US. Recently, I lived in [a van](https://instagram.com/serenitythevan) with my fianc√©e (by choice).

### My experience

If you're interested in a curated list of my best projects, [look no further](/projects). You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xavdid), which is is all of the public code I've ever written.

My main expertise is in `Typescript` and `Javascript`, especially as they pertain to `Node.js` both on the server or CLI. I'm also handy with `Python` and `React.js`. Once upon a time, I wrote a lot of `Ruby`.

### My media lists

I maintain a comprehensive list of everything I play, read, and watch. Partly to source info for my [yearly media awards blog post](/blog/post/my-favorite-media-of-the-year-2019-edition/), but also just because it's fun. Each follows my [4-point media rating system](/blog/post/on-the-rating-of-media/). Check them out:
